## üîé Problem Statement

In Eastern Africa, approximately **10-15% of the population** consists of individuals living with disabilities. However, they face:
- **Limited access to affordable insurance policies**, as most insurers exclude PWDs from comprehensive coverage.
- **Insufficient healthcare services** tailored to their specific needs.
- **High cost of assistive technologies**, with little or no financial support.
- A **lack of centralized, easily accessible platforms** for managing healthcare, insurance, and assistive technology needs.

This app aims to solve these issues by creating an ecosystem that addresses the gap in insurance, healthcare, and financial services for PWDs.

### Relevant Statistics:
- **15% of the world's population** (about 1 billion people) live with some form of disability, with a large percentage in developing regions like Africa.
- In Kenya, approximately **4.6% of the population** has a disability, with limited access to insurance coverage, healthcare, and assistive tools.
